This Node.js backend project is designed to provide a robust event review system
for managing data and user authentication, including email verification. It utilizes
Express.js for handling HTTP requests and MongoDB as the database for data storage.
The APIs have been extensively tested using Postman to ensure functionality and reliability.

The authentication system includes features such as password hashing using bcrypt for 
enhanced security, email verification to ensure valid user accounts, and JWT tokens for
secure user authentication and authorization. These components collectively contribute 
to a stable and secure backend infrastructure for web applications.
